# Site Blocker

This is a chrome extension to block specific sites.

There are existing solutions like the following.
- [StayFocusd](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stayfocusd-%E2%80%93-website-bloc/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji)
- [Freedom](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/freedom-website-blocker-f/abdkjmofmjelgafcdffaimhgdgpagmop)

But I want complete control on what websites to block.
For example, I use reddit for mindless scrolling (bad) and work (good),
and I ONLY want to block www.reddit.com and I want to visite reddit links from google search.
That's why I created this supper simple site locker.

Free free to fork and adapt to your use case.
